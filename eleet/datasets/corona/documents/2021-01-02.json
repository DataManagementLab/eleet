{"text": "Summary (as of 02/01/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general\r\npopulation as very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 12,690 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 336 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to the RKI\r\nin Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 141 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony and Thuringia, it is markedly above the national\r\nincidence.\r\n\u2022 All 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 289 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 39\r\ndistricts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and 2 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 116 and of people \u226580 years 290 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households and\r\nnursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 02/01/2021 (12:15 PM) 5,726 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, 437 existing patients were discharged\r\n(35% of whom had died) and 565 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment was 128 less than one day\r\nprior.\r\n\u2022 On 12/19/2020, a new virus variant was reported in the UK. The ECDC published a Risk Assessment on 29/12/2020. To date, it is unknown how\r\nthe new virus variant will affect the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, a few cases of this new variant have been transmitted to the RKI. Further cases\r\nmay be expected.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 188,553 people in Germany have been vaccinated against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).\r\n\u2022 Testing and
