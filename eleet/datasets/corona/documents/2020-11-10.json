{"text": "Summary (as of 10/11/2020, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, an increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore, the entire population is\r\nstrongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.\r\n\u2022 The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days is 139.1 cases per 100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day\r\nincidence of people \u2265 60 years is currently 94.2 cases/100.000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony is higher than the national total\r\n7-day incidence.\r\n\u2022 Almost all districts have a high 7-day incidence. Only 6 districts have an incidence \u226425 cases/100,000 population. As of\r\ntoday, 31 districts have an incidence of >25-50 cases /100,000 population, 107 districts have an incidence of >50-100\r\ncases/100,000 population, 268 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 15 districts have\r\nan incidence of >250 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The nationwide increase is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters in connection with private\r\ngatherings, celebrations or public events, but also in community institutions, nursing and long-term care homes, as well as\r\nin occupational settings or related to religious events.\r\n\u2022 The number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care has almost tripled in the past 2 weeks from 1,470 patients on\r\n27/10/2020 to 3,059 patients on 10/11/2020.\r\n\u2022 In total, 687,299 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 11,506 deaths associated with COVID-19 have been transmitted\r\nto the RKI in Germany.", "report_number": "2020-11-10",
