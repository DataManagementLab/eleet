{"text": "Summary (as of 24/01/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now assesses the level of threat to the health\r\nof the general population as very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 12,257 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 349 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were\r\ntransmitted to the RKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 111 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg, Saxony,\r\nSaxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is markedly above the national incidence.\r\n\u2022 Of 412 districts, 389 have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 220 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population\r\nand of these, 12 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 88 and of people \u226580 years 237 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in\r\nhouseholds, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 24/01/2021 (12:15 PM) 4,628 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, +351 existing patients had\r\nbeen discharged (39% of whom had died) and +319 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under\r\ntreatment was -32 more than the prior day.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 1,469,353 people in Germany have been vaccinated once (vaccination rate 1.8%) and 163,424 people\r\ntwice against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).", "report_number": "2021-01-24", "mentions": {"date": [{"mention": "24/01/2021", "start": 15, "length": 10}],
