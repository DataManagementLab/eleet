{"text": "Summary (as of 10/02/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany remains high. RKI assesses the level of threat to the\r\nhealth of the general population to be very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 8,072 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 813 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were\r\ntransmitted to the RKI. The national 7-day incidence is 68 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg, Saarland, SaxonyAnhalt, and Thuringia it is considerably above the national incidence.\r\n\u2022 In 289 of the 412 districts, the 7-day COVID-19 incidence is high (>50 cases/100,000 population). In 66 districts, the 7-day\r\nincidence is >100 cases/100,000 population and in 4 of these districts it is >250-500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence among people aged 60-79 years is currently 53 and of people aged \u226580 years, 117 cases/100,000\r\npopulation.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in\r\nhouseholds, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 10/02/2021 (12:15 PM) 3,736 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, +459 existing patients had\r\nbeen discharged (27% of whom had died) and +349 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under\r\ntreatment was -110 more than the prior day.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 2,405,156 people in Germany have been vaccinated at least once (vaccination rate 2.9%) and\r\n1,104,504 people twice (vaccination rate 1.3%) against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).\r\n\u2022 In this situation report, the following additional information is
