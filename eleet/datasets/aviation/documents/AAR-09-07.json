{"text": "On September 27, 2008, about 2358 eastern daylight time, an Aerospatiale (Eurocopter) SA365N1, N92MD, call sign Trooper 2, registered to and operated by the Maryland State Police (MSP) as a public medical evacuation flight, impacted terrain about 3.2 miles north of the runway 19R threshold at Andrews Air Force Base (ADW), Camp Springs, Maryland, during an instrument landing system approach. The commercial pilot, one flight paramedic, one field provider, and one of two automobile accident patients being transported were killed. The other patient being transported survived with serious injuries from the helicopter accident and was taken to a local hospital. The helicopter was substantially damaged when it collided with trees and terrain in Walker Mill Regional Park, District Heights, Maryland. The flight originated from a landing zone at Wade Elementary School, Waldorf, Maryland, about 2337, destined for Prince George's Hospital Center, Cheverly, Maryland. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the departure; however, Trooper 2 encountered instrument meteorological conditions en route to the hospital and diverted to ADW. No flight plan was filed with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and none was required. The MSP System Communications Center (SYSCOM) was tracking the flight using global positioning system data transmitted with an experimental automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast communications link.", "report_number": "AAR-09-07", "mentions": {"event_date": [{"mention": "September 27, 2008", "start": 3, "length": 18}], "location_city": [{"mention": "District Heights", "start": 775, "length": 16}], "location_state": [{"mention": "Maryland", "start": 338, "length": 8}, {"mention": "Maryland", "start": 793, "length": 8}, {"mention": "Maryland", "start": 881, "length": 8}, {"mention": "Maryland", "start": 959, "length": 8}], "airport_code": [{"mention": "ADW", "start": 318, "length": 3}, {"mention": "ADW", "start": 1146, "length": 3}], "airport_name": [{"mention": "Andrews Air Force Base", "start": 294, "length": 22}], "aircraft_damage": [{"mention": "substantially damaged", "start": 683, "length": 21}], "aircraft_registration_number": [{"mention": "N92MD", "start": 95, "length": 5}], "aircraft_make": [{"mention": "Aerospatiale (Eurocopter)", "start": 60, "length": 25}, {"mention": "Aerospatiale", "start": 60, "length": 12}, {"mention": "Eurocopter", "start": 74, "length": 10}], "aircraft_model": [{"mention": "SA365N1", "start": 86, "length": 7}], "far_description": [], "air_carrier": [{"mention": "Maryland State Police (MSP)", "start": 157, "length": 27}, {"mention": "Maryland State Police", "start": 157, "length": 21}], "total_fatal_injuries": [{"mention": "The commercial pilot, one flight paramedic, one field provider, and one of two automobile accident patients being transported were killed", "start": 394, "length": 137}], "total_serious_injuries": [{"mention": "The other patient being transported survived with serious injuries", "start": 533, "length": 66}], "total_minor_injuries": [{"mention": "The commercial pilot, one flight paramedic, one field provider, and one of two automobile accident patients being transported were killed.
