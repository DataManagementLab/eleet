{"text": "Summary (as of 24/12/2020, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly encouraged to\r\ncommit itself to infection prevention and control even more dedicatedly than before.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 32,195 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 802 new deaths associated with COVID-19 have been transmitted to\r\nthe RKI in Germany .The national 7-day incidence is 196 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony and Thuringia, it is considerably above the\r\nnational incidence.\r\n\u2022 All of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 359 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,\r\n87 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and 5 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day incidence of people \u226560\r\nyears is currently 201 cases/100,000 population and since yesterday above the national incidence.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households and\r\nnursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 24/12/2020 (12:15 PM) 5,354 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the leading 24 hours, +762 existing patients had been\r\ndischarged (25% of which had died) and +873 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of ongoing cases was +111 more than the\r\nprior day.\r\n\u2022 RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general population as very high.\r\n\u2022 On 12/19/2020, a new virus variant was reported in the UK. The ECDC has published a Rapid Risk Assessment on 20/12/2020. To date, it is\r\nunknown how the new virus variant will affect the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, the new virus variant has not yet been notified to RKI.\r\n\u2022 RKI will not publish any daily situation report on December 25 and January 1, 2021. Testing and notification activities may be lower during the\r\nfestive season, possibly resulting in an incomplete picture of the epidemiological situation in Germany.
