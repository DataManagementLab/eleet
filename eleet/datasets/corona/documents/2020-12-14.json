{"text": "Summary (as of 14/12/2020, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly\r\nencouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.\r\n\u2022 Since 04/12/2020, the case numbers show a sharp increase again. The national 7-day incidence is 176 cases per 100,000\r\npopulation. In Saxony it is more than twice as high; in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, Berlin, Hesse, Saarland and Thuringia\r\nit is slightly to markedly above the overall incidence.\r\n\u2022 Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day\r\nincidence of people \u226560 years is currently 165 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 Almost all of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. Only 1 district has an incidence of \u226425 cases/100,000\r\npopulation. In comparison, 346 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 49 districts have\r\nan incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and 7 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in\r\nhouseholds and nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to\r\nreligious events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.\r\n\u2022 With 4,6702 cases, the current number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care continues to increase.\r\n\u2022 On 14/12/2020, 16,362 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases have been transmitted to the RKI in Germany, as well as\r\n188 new deaths associated with COVID-19.\r\n\u2022 RKI\u2019s risk assessment was updated.
