{"text": "Summary (as of 13/12/2020, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly\r\nencouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.\r\n\u2022 Since 04/12/2020, the case numbers show a sharp increase again. The national 7-day incidence is 169 cases per 100,000\r\npopulation. In Saxony it is more than twice as high; in Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria markedly, in Berlin, Hesse and\r\nThuringia, it is slightly above the overall incidence.\r\n\u2022 Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day\r\nincidence of people \u226560 years is currently 157 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 Almost all of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. Only 1 district has an incidence of \u226425 cases/100,000\r\npopulation. In comparison, 331 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 49 districts have\r\nan incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and 4 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in\r\nhouseholds and nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to\r\nreligious events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.\r\n\u2022 With 4,552 cases, the current number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care continues to increase.\r\n\u2022 On 12/12/2020, 20,200 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases have been transmitted to the RKI in Germany, as well as\r\n321 new deaths associated with COVID-19.\r\n\u2022 RKI\u2019s risk assessment was updated.
