{"text": "Summary (as of 22/01/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now assesses the level of threat to the\r\nhealth of the general population as very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 17,862 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 859 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were\r\ntransmitted to the RKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 115 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg,\r\nSaxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is markedly above the national incidence.\r\n\u2022 Of 412 districts, 391 have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 237 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000\r\npopulation and of these, 20 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 73 and of people \u226580 years 202 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in\r\nhouseholds, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 22/01/2021, 4,768 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, +623 existing patients had been\r\ndischarged (34% of whom had died) and +604 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment\r\nwas 19 less than the prior day.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 1,386,464 people in Germany have been vaccinated once (vaccination rate 1.7%) and 115,175\r\npeople twice against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).\r\n\u2022 In this situation report, the following additional information is given: Mortality Monitoring",
