{"text": "Summary (as of 19/02/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany remains high. RKI assesses the level of threat to the\r\nhealth of the general population to be very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 9,113 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 508 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were\r\ntransmitted to the RKI. The national 7-day incidence is 57 cases per 100,000 population. The incidence in Saxony-Anhalt is\r\nmoderately and in Thuringia considerably above the national incidence.\r\n\u2022 In 218 of the 412 districts, the 7-day COVID-19 incidence is high (>50 cases/100,000 population). In 43 districts, the 7-day\r\nincidence is >100 cases/100,000 population and in 2 of these districts it is >250-500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence among people aged 60-79 years is currently 43 and among the age group \u226580 years 80 cases/100,000\r\npopulation.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in\r\nhouseholds, occupational settings as well as nursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 19/02/2021 (12:15 PM) 3,121 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, +349 existing patients had\r\nbeen discharged (25% of whom had died) and +293 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under\r\ntreatment was 56 less than the prior day.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 3,085,114 people in Germany have been vaccinated at least once (vaccination rate 3.7%) and of\r\nthose und 1,634,786 people twice (vaccination rate 2.0%) against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).\r\n\u2022 In this situation report, the following additional
