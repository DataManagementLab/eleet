{"text": "Summary (as of 27/11/2020, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, an increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore, the entire population is\r\nstrongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saxony and Thuringia is higher than the national\r\ntotal 7-day incidence of 136 cases per 100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day\r\nincidence of people \u2265 60 years is currently 111 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 Almost all districts have a high 7-day incidence. Only 7 districts have an incidence of \u2264 25 cases/100,000 population. In\r\ncomparison, 265 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 24 districts have an incidence\r\nof >250-500 cases/100,000 population and one district of >500-1000 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters in households,\r\nbut also in community institutions, nursing and long-term care homes, as well as in occupational settings or related to\r\nreligious events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.\r\n\u2022 The proportion of outbreaks with 5 people within the settings of nursing homes has continuously and considerably increased\r\nsince week 38.\r\n\u2022 Between mid-October and mid-November, the number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care increased dramatically,\r\nfrom 655 patients on 15/10/2020 to 3,395 on 15/11/2020. Since then, the increase has slowed down slightly, with 3,854\r\ncases on 27/11/2020\r\n\u2022 On 27/11/2020, 22.806 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 426 new deaths associated with COVID-19
