{"text": "Summary (as of 22/12/2020, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly encouraged to\r\ncommit itself to infection prevention and control even more dedicatedly than before.\r\n\u2022 Since 04/12/2020, the case numbers show a sharp increase again. The national 7-day incidence is 198 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony\r\nand Thuringia, it is considerably above the national incidence.\r\n\u2022 Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day incidence of people \u226560\r\nyears is currently 196 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 Almost all of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. No district had an incidence of \u226425 cases/100,000 population. In\r\ncomparison, 364 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 72 districts have an incidence of >250-500\r\ncases/100,000 population and 9 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households and\r\nnursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to religious events. For a large\r\nproportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 19,528 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 731 new deaths associated with COVID-19 have been transmitted to\r\nthe RKI in Germany. With 5,216 cases, the number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care continues to increase.\r\n\u2022 RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general population as very high.\r\n\u2022 The Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) published recommendations for the COVID-19 vaccination (17/12/2020).\r\n\u2022 On 12/19/2020, a new virus variant was reported in the UK. The ECDC has published a Rapid Risk Assessment on 20/12/2020. To date, it is\r\nunknown how the new virus variant will affect the COVID-19 pandemic.
