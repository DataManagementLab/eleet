{"text": "Summary (as of 14/01/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general\r\npopulation as very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 25,164 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 1,244 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to the\r\nRKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 151 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony, Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt it is markedly above\r\nthe national incidence.\r\n\u2022 All 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 310 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,\r\n51 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population, and one district have an incidence of >500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 118 and of people \u226580 years 305 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households,\r\noccupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 14/01/2021, 5,125 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, 604 existing patients had been discharged (31 % of\r\nwhom had died) and 544 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment was 60 less than the prior day.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 842.455 people in Germany have been vaccinated against COVID-19 (10,1 vaccinated per 1,000 population)\r\n(http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).", "report_number": "2021-01-14", "mentions": {"date": [{"mention": "14/01/2021", "start": 15, "length": 10}], "new_cases": [{"mention":
