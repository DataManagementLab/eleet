{"text": "Summary (as of 23/12/2020, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly encouraged to\r\ncommit itself to infection prevention and control even more dedicatedly than before.\r\n\u2022 The national 7-day incidence is 195 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony and Thuringia, it is considerably above the national incidence.\r\n\u2022 Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day incidence of people \u226560\r\nyears is currently 197 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 Almost all of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 356 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of\r\nthese, 75 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and 7 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households and\r\nnursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to religious events. For a large\r\nproportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 24,740 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 962 new deaths associated with COVID-19 have been transmitted to\r\nthe RKI in Germany. With 5,243 cases, the number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care continues to increase.\r\n\u2022 RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general population as very high.\r\n\u2022 On 12/19/2020, a new virus variant was reported in the UK. The ECDC has published a Rapid Risk Assessment on 20/12/2020. To date, it is\r\nunknown how the new virus variant will affect the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, the new virus variant has not yet been detected in Germany.\r\n\u2022 RKI will not publish any daily situation report on December 24 and January 1, 2021.
