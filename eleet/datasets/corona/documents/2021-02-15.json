{"text": "Summary (as of 15/02/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany remains high. RKI assesses the level of threat to the\r\nhealth of the general population to be very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 4,426 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 116 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were\r\ntransmitted to the RKI. The national 7-day incidence is 59 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg, Saarland, Saxony,\r\nSaxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is considerably above the national incidence.\r\n\u2022 In 245 of the 412 districts, the 7-day COVID-19 incidence is high (>50 cases/100,000 population). In 43 districts, the 7-day\r\nincidence is >100 cases/100,000 population and in 2 of these districts it is >250-500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence among people aged 60-79 years is currently 45 and of people aged \u226580 years, 89 cases/100,000\r\npopulation.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in\r\nhouseholds, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 15/02/2021 (as of 12:15 PM) 3,439 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, 291 existing patients\r\nhad been discharged (37% of whom had died) and 303 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under\r\ntreatment was 12 more than the prior day.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 2.736,109 people in Germany have been vaccinated at least once (vaccination rate 3.3%) and of\r\nthose 1,410,239 people twice (vaccination rate 1.7%) against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).", "report_number": "2021-02-15", "mentions": {"date": [{"mention":
