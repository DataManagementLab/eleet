{"text": "Summary (as of 03/12/2020, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly\r\nencouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saxony and Thuringia is higher than the national\r\ntotal 7-day incidence of 138 cases per 100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day\r\nincidence of people \u2265 60 years is currently 124 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 Almost all of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. Only 13 districts have an incidence of \u2264 25\r\ncases/100,000 population. In comparison, 281 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,\r\n29 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and one district of >500-1000 cases/100,000\r\npopulation.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in\r\nhouseholds and nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to\r\nreligious events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.\r\n\u2022 After the strong increase in the number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care until mid-November (3,395 cases on\r\n15/11/2020), the increase has slowed somewhat, with 4,051 cases on 05/12/2020.\r\n\u2022 On 05/12/2020, 23,318 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 483 new deaths associated with COVID-19 have\r\nbeen transmitted to the RKI in Germany.
