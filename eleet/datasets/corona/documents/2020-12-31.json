{"text": "Summary (as of 31/12/2020, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general\r\npopulation as very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 32,552 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 964 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to the RKI\r\nin Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 140 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony and Thuringia, it is markedly above the national\r\nincidence.\r\n\u2022 All 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 288 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 35\r\ndistricts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and 3 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 114 and of people \u226580 years 280 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households and\r\nnursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 31/12/2020 (12:15 PM) 5,639 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, 746 existing patients had been\r\ndischarged (37% of whom had died) and 737 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment was 9 less than\r\none day prior.\r\n\u2022 On 12/19/2020, a new virus variant was reported in the UK. The ECDC has published a Rapid Risk Assessment on 20/12/2020. To date, it is\r\nunknown how the new virus variant will affect the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, a few cases of this new variant have been transmitted to the\r\nRKI. Further cases may be expected.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 131,626 people in Germany have been vaccinated against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).\r\n\u2022 On January 1, 2021 no situation report will be released. Testing and notification activities may be lower during the festive season, resulting in a\r\nputatively incomplete picture of the epidemiological situation in Germany.
