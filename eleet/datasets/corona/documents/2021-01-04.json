{"text": "Summary (as of 04/01/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general\r\npopulation as very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 9,847 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 302 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to the RKI\r\nin Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 139 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony and Thuringia, it is markedly above the national\r\nincidence.\r\n\u2022 All 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 292 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 42\r\ndistricts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and 2 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 115 and of people \u226580 years 285 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households and\r\nnursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 04/01/2021 (12:15 PM) 5,744 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, 601 existing patients were discharged\r\n(34% of whom had died) and 583 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment was -18 less than the prior\r\nday.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 265,986 people in Germany have been vaccinated against COVID-19
