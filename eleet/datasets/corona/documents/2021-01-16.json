{"text": "Summary (as of 16/01/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general\r\npopulation as very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 18,678 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 980 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to the RKI\r\nin Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 139 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is\r\nmarkedly above the national incidence.\r\n\u2022 All 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 297 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,\r\n32 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population, and one district has an incidence of >500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 107 and of people \u226580 years 289 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households,\r\noccupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 16/01/2021, 5,015 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, 396 existing patients had been discharged (37 % of\r\nwhom had died) and 337 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment was 59 less than the prior day.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 1,048,160 people in Germany have been vaccinated against COVID-19 (12.6 vaccinated per 1,000 population)\r\n(http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).", "report_number": "2021-01-16", "mentions": {"date": [{"mention": "16/01/2021", "start": 15, "length": 10}], "new_cases":
