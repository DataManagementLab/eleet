  "text": "Summary (as of 06/12/2020, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly\r\nencouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin and Thuringia is considerably, in Saxony even more considerably higher than the\r\nnational total 7-day incidence of 142 cases per 100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day\r\nincidence of people \u2265 60 years is currently 128 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 Almost all of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. Only 10 districts transmitted an incidence of \u226425\r\ncases/100,000 population. In comparison, 279 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,\r\n30 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and two districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in\r\nhouseholds and nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to\r\nreligious events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.\r\n\u2022 After the strong increase in the number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care until mid-November (3,395 cases on\r\n15/11/2020), the increase has slowed somewhat, with 4,108 cases on 06/12/2020.\r\n\u2022 On 06/12/2020, 17,767 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 255 new deaths associated with COVID-19 have\r\nbeen transmitted to the RKI in Germany.",
