  "text": "Summary (as of 12/12/2020, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly\r\nencouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.\r\n\u2022 Since 04/12/2020, the case numbers show a sharp increase again. The national 7-day incidence is 163 cases per 100,000\r\npopulation. In Saxony it is more than twice as high; in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, Berlin, Hesse, Saarland and Thuringia,\r\nit is markedly above the overall incidence.\r\n\u2022 Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day\r\nincidence of people \u226560 years is currently 150 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 Almost all of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. Only 4 districts have an incidence of \u226425\r\ncases/100,000 population. In comparison, 328 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,\r\n42 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and 2 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in\r\nhouseholds and nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to\r\nreligious events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.\r\n\u2022 With 4,491 cases, the current number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care continues to increase.\r\n\u2022 On 11/12/2020, 28,438 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases have been transmitted to the RKI in Germany, as well as\r\n496 new deaths associated with COVID-19.\r\n\u2022 RKI\u2019s risk assessment was updated. RKI now judges the level of danger to the health of the general population as very high.",
