{"text": "Summary (as of 08/02/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany remains high. RKI assesses the level of threat to the\r\nhealth of the general population to be very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, +4,535 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 158 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were\r\ntransmitted to the RKI. The national 7-day incidence is 76 cases per 100,000 population. In Saarland, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt,\r\nand Thuringia it is considerably above the national incidence.\r\n\u2022 In 319 of the 412 districts, the 7-day COVID-19 incidence is high (>50 cases/100,000 population). In 96 districts, the 7-day\r\nincidence is >100 cases/100,000 population and in 6 of these districts it is >250-500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence among people aged 60-79 years is currently 60 and of people aged \u226580 years, 132 cases/100,000\r\npopulation.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in\r\nhouseholds, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 08/02/2021 (12:15 PM) 3,957 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, +348 existing patients had\r\nbeen discharged (42% of whom had died) and +372 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under\r\ntreatment was +24 more than the prior day.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 2,295,221 people in Germany have been vaccinated at least once (vaccination rate 2.8%) and\r\n981,914 people twice (vaccination rate 1.2%) against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).", "report_number": "2021-02-08", "mentions": {"date": [{"mention": "08/02/2021",
