{"text": "Summary (as of 23/01/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now assesses the level of threat to the health\r\nof the general population as very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 16,417 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 879 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were\r\ntransmitted to the RKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 113 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg, Saxony,\r\nSaxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is markedly above the national incidence.\r\n\u2022 Of 412 districts, 392 have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 224 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population\r\nand of these, 14 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 88 and of people \u226580 years 240 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in\r\nhouseholds, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 23/01/2021, 4,660 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, +586 existing patients had been\r\ndischarged (32% of whom had died) and +478 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment\r\nwas 108 less than the prior day.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 1,469,353 people in Germany have been vaccinated once (vaccination rate 1.8%) and 163,424 people\r\ntwice against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).", "report_number": "2021-01-23", "mentions": {"date": [{"mention": "23/01/2021", "start": 15, "length": 10}],
