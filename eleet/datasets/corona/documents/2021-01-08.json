{"text": "Summary (as of 08/01/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general\r\npopulation as very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 31,849 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 1.188 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to the\r\nRKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 137 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony and Thuringia, it is markedly above the national\r\nincidence.\r\n\u2022 410 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 280 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 37 districts\r\nhave an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population, and one district has an incidence of >500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 109 and of people \u226580 years 262 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households and\r\nnursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 08/01/2021 5,484 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, 564 existing patients were discharged (32 % of\r\nwhom had died) and 557 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment was 7 less than the prior day.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 476,959 people in Germany have been vaccinated against COVID-19 (5,7 vaccinated per 1,000 population)\r\n(http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).\r\n\u2022 Testing and notification activities may have been lower during the festive season, resulting in a putatively incomplete picture of the\r\nepidemiological situation in Germany of the previous two weeks.
