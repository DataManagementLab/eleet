{"text": "Summary (as of 13/01/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the\r\ngeneral population as very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 19,600 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 1,060 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to\r\nthe RKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 155 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony and Thuringia, it is markedly above the\r\nnational incidence.\r\n\u2022 All 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 319 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,\r\n54 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population, and two districts have an incidence of >500 cases/100,000\r\npopulation.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 122 and of people \u226580 years 303 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households,\r\noccupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 13/01/2021, 5,185 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, 666 existing patients had been discharged (32 %\r\nof whom had died) and 621 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment was 45 less than the prior day.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 758,093 people in Germany have been vaccinated against COVID-19 (9.1 vaccinated per 1,000 population)\r\n(http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).", "report_number": "2021-01-13", "mentions": {"date": [{"mention": "13/01/2021", "start": 15, "length": 10}], "new_cases": [{"mention":
