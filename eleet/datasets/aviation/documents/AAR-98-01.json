{"text": "On July 6, 1996, at 1424 central daylight time, a McDonnell Douglas MD-88, N927DA, operated by Delta Air Lines Inc., as flight 1288, experienced an engine failure during the initial part of its takeoff roll on runway 17 at Pensacola Regional Airport in Pensacola, Florida. Uncontained engine debris from the front compressor front hub (fan hub) of the No. 1 (left) engine penetrated the left aft fuselage. Two passengers were killed and two others were seriously injured. The takeoff was rejected, and the airplane was stopped on the runway. The airplane, which was being operated by Delta as a scheduled domestic passenger flight under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121, with 137 passengers and 5 crew on board, was destined for Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia.\r\n\r\nSafety issues discussed in this report include the limitations of the blue etch anodize process, manufacturing defects, standards for the fluorescent penetrant inspection process, the performance of nondestructive testing, the use of alarm systems for emergency situations, and instructions regarding emergency exits.
