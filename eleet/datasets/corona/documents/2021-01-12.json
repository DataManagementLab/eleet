{"text": "Summary (as of 12/01/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the\r\ngeneral population as very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 12,802 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 891 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to the\r\nRKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 164 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony and Thuringia, it is markedly above the\r\nnational incidence.\r\n\u2022 All 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 342 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,\r\n53 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population, and four districts have an incidence of >500 cases/100,000\r\npopulation.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 130 and of people \u226580 years 317 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households,\r\noccupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 12/01/2021, 5,230 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, 834 existing patients had been discharged (35%\r\nof whom had died) and 775 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment was 59 less than the prior day.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 688,782 people in Germany have been vaccinated against COVID-19 (8.3 vaccinated per 1,000 population)\r\n(http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).\r\n", "report_number": "2021-01-12", "mentions": {"date": [{"mention": "12/01/2021", "start": 15, "length": 10}], "new_cases":
