{"text": "On January 15, 2009, about 1527 eastern standard time, US Airways flight 1549, an Airbus Industrie A320-214, N106US, experienced an almost complete loss of thrust in both engines after encountering a flock of birds and was subsequently ditched on the Hudson River about 8.5 miles from LaGuardia Airport (LGA), New York City, New York. The flight was en route to Charlotte Douglas International Airport, Charlotte, North Carolina, and had departed LGA about 2 minutes before the in-flight event occurred. The 150 passengers, including a lap-held child, and 5 crewmembers evacuated the airplane via the forward and overwing exits. One flight attendant and four passengers were seriously injured, and the airplane was substantially damaged. The scheduled, domestic passenger flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 on an instrument flight rules flight plan. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.\r\n\r\nContributing to the survivability of the accident was (1) the decision-making of the flight crewmembers and their crew resource management during the accident sequence; (2) the fortuitous use of an airplane that was equipped for an extended overwater flight, including the availability of the forward slide/rafts, even though it was not required to be so equipped; (3) the performance of the cabin crewmembers while expediting the evacuation of the airplane; and (4) the proximity of the emergency responders to the accident site and their immediate and appropriate response to the accident.\r\n\r\nThe safety issues discussed in this report relate to the following: in-flight engine diagnostics, engine bird-ingestion certification testing, emergency and abnormal checklist design, dual-engine failure and ditching training, training on the effects of flight envelope limitations on airplane response to pilot inputs, validation of operational procedures and requirements for airplane ditching certification, and wildlife hazard mitigation. The report also discusses survival-related issues, including passenger brace positions; slide/raft stowage; passenger immersion protection; life line usage; life vest stowage, retrieval, and donning; preflight safety briefings; and passenger education. Safety recommendations concerning these issues are addressed to the FAA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the European Aviation Safety Agency.", "report_number": "AAR-10-03", "mentions": {"event_date": [{"mention": "January 15, 2009", "start": 3, "length": 16}], "location_city": [{"mention": "New York City", "start": 310, "length": 13}], "location_state": [{"mention": "New York", "start": 325, "length": 8}, {"mention": "North Carolina", "start": 414, "length": 14}], "airport_code": [{"mention": "LGA", "start": 304, "length": 3}, {"mention": "LGA", "start": 447, "length": 3}], "airport_name": [{"mention": "LaGuardia Airport", "start": 285, "length": 17}], "aircraft_damage": [{"mention": "substantially damaged", "start": 715, "length": 21}], "aircraft_registration_number": [{"mention": "N106US", "start": 109, "length": 6}], "aircraft_make": [{"mention": "Airbus Industrie", "start": 82, "length": 16}, {"mention": "Airbus", "start": 82, "length": 6}], "aircraft_model": [{"mention": "A320-214", "start": 99, "length": 8}], "far_description": [{"mention": "14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121", "start": 817, "length": 39}, {"mention": "Part 121", "start": 848, "length": 8}, {"mention": "121", "start": 853, "length": 3}], "air_carrier": [{"mention": "US Airways", "start": 55, "length": 10}], "total_fatal_injuries": [{"mention": "The 150 passengers, including a lap-held child, and 5 crewmembers evacuated the airplane via the forward and overwing exits.
