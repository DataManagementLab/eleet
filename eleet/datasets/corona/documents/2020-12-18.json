{"text": "Summary (as of 18/12/2020, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly encouraged\r\nto commit itself to infection prevention and control even more dedicatedly than before.\r\n\u2022 Since 04/12/2020, the case numbers show a sharp increase again. The national 7-day incidence is 185 cases per 100,000 population. In\r\nSaxony and Thuringia it is severely above the overall incidence.\r\n\u2022 Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day incidence of\r\npeople \u226560 years is currently 178 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 Almost all of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. Only 1 district has an incidence of \u226425 cases/100,000 population.\r\nIn comparison, 361 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 57 districts have an incidence of >250-\r\n500 cases/100,000 population and 10 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households\r\nand nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to religious events. For a\r\nlarge proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.\r\n\u2022 With 4,899 cases, the current number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care continues to increase.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 33,777 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases have been transmitted to the RKI in Germany, as well as 813 new deaths\r\nassociated with COVID-19. This includes about 3,500 cases that have been transmitted with a delay of one day.\r\n\u2022 RKI\u2019s risk assessment was updated. RKI now judges the level of danger to the health of the general population as very high.\r\n\u2022 The Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) published recommendations for the COVID-19 vaccination
