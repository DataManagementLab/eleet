{"text": "Summary (as of 09/02/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany remains high. RKI assesses the level of threat to the\r\nhealth of the general population to be very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 3.379 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 481 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were\r\ntransmitted to the RKI. The national 7-day incidence is 73 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg, Saarland, SaxonyAnhalt, and Thuringia it is considerably above the national incidence. Data of ca. 600 cases from North Rhine-Westphalia was\r\nnot processed in time yesterday and will be reported tomorrow.\r\n\u2022 In 313 of the 412 districts, the 7-day COVID-19 incidence is high (>50 cases/100,000 population). In 92 districts, the 7-day\r\nincidence is >100 cases/100,000 population and in 4 of these districts it is >250-500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence among people aged 60-79 years is currently 57 and of people aged \u226580 years, 124 cases/100,000\r\npopulation.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in\r\nhouseholds, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 09/02/2021 (12:15 PM) 3,846 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, 525 existing patients had\r\nbeen discharged (31% of whom had died) and 414 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under\r\ntreatment was 111 less than the prior day.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 2,344,802 people in Germany have been vaccinated at least once (vaccination rate 2.8%) and\r\n1,024,631 people twice (vaccination rate 1.2%) against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).\r\n\u2022 In this situation report, the following additional information is given:
