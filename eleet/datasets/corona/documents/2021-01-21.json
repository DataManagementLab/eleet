{"text": "Summary (as of 21/01/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now assesses the level of threat to the\r\nhealth of the general population as very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 20,398 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 1,013 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were\r\ntransmitted to the RKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 119 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg,\r\nSaxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is markedly above the national incidence.\r\n\u2022 Of 412 districts, 392 have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 243 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000\r\npopulation and of these, 22 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 93 and of people \u226580 years 259 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in\r\nhouseholds, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 21/01/2021, 4,787 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care (-49 cases fewer than the day before). In the preceding 24\r\nhours, +769 existing patients had been discharged (28% of whom had died) and +720 patients were newly admitted. The\r\nresulting number of cases under treatment was -49 more than the prior day.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 1,324,091 people in Germany have been vaccinated once (vaccination rate 1.6%) and 77,602\r\npeople twice against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).\r\n\u2022 In this situation report, the following additional information is given: information from additional RKI
