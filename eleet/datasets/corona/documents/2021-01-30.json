{"text": "Summary (as of 30/01/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now assesses the level of threat\r\nto the health of the general population as very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 12,321 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 749 new deaths associated with COVID-19\r\nwere transmitted to the RKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 91 cases per 100,000 population. In\r\nBrandenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is markedly above the national incidence.\r\n\u2022 Of 412 districts, 366 have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 147 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000\r\npopulation and of these, 7 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 73 and of people \u226580 years 180 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters\r\nespecially in households, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 30/01/2021 (12:15 PM) 4,352 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, 417 existing\r\npatients had been discharged (29% of whom had died) and 394 patients were newly admitted. The resulting\r\nnumber of cases under treatment was -23 more than the prior day.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 1,855,457 people in Germany have been vaccinated at least once (vaccination rate\r\n2.2%) and 461,701 people twice against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).", "report_number": "2021-01-30", "mentions": {"date": [{"mention": "30/01/2021", "start": 15, "length":
