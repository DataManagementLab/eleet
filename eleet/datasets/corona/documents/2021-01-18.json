{"text": "Summary (as of 18/01/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now assesses the level of threat to the health of the general\r\npopulation as very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 7,141 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 214 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to the RKI\r\nin Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 134 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is\r\nmarkedly above the national incidence.\r\n\u2022 All 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 285 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,\r\n30 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 104 and of people \u226580 years 282 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households,\r\noccupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 18/01/2021, 5,003 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, 515 patients had been discharged (39 % of whom\r\nhad died) and 547 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment was 32 more than the prior day.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 1,139,297 people in Germany have been vaccinated once (vaccination rate 1.4%) and 6,581 people twice against\r\nCOVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).", "report_number": "2021-01-18", "mentions": {"date": [{"mention": "18/01/2021", "start": 15, "length": 10}],
