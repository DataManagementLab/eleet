{"text": "Summary (as of 27/12/2020, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general\r\npopulation as very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 13,755 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 356 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to the RKI\r\nin Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 161 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony and Thuringia, it is markedly above the national\r\nincidence.\r\n\u2022 Almost all of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 327 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of\r\nthese, 53 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and 2 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence of people \u226560 years is currently 171 cases/100,000 population and above the national incidence since 23/12/2020.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households and\r\nnursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 27/12/2020 (12:15 PM) 5,562 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the leading 24 hours, +575 existing patients had been\r\ndischarged (39% of which had died) and +602 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of ongoing cases was +27 more than the\r\nprior day.\r\n\u2022 On 12/19/2020, a new virus variant was reported in the UK. The ECDC has published a Rapid Risk Assessment on 20/12/2020. To date, it is\r\nunknown how the new virus variant will affect the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, one case with the new variant virus has been reported in\r\nGermany (Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg). Further cases may be expected.\r\n\u2022 Today, 27th of December 2020, vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 have started in all federal states.\r\n\u2022 On January 1, 2021 no situation report will be released. Testing and notification activities may be lower during the festive season, resulting in a\r\nputatively incomplete picture of the epidemiological situation in Germany.
