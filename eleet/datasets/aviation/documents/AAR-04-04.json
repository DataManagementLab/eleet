{"text": "\u200bOn November 12, 2001, about 0916:15 eastern standard time, American Airlines flight 587, an Airbus Industrie A300-605R, N14053, crashed into a residential area of Belle Harbor, New York, shortly after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport, Jamaica, New York. Flight 587 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight to Las Americas International Airport, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, with 2 flight crewmembers, 7 flight attendants, and 251 passengers aboard the airplane. The airplane\u2019s vertical stabilizer and rudder separated in flight and were found in Jamaica Bay, about 1 mile north of the main wreckage site. The airplane\u2019s engines subsequently separated in flight and were found several blocks north and east of the main wreckage site. All 260 people aboard the airplane and 5 people on the ground were killed, and the airplane was destroyed by impact forces and a postcrash fire. Flight 587 was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 on an instrument flight rules flight plan. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.\r\n\r\nThe safety issues discussed in this report focus on characteristics of the A300-600 rudder control system design, A300-600 rudder pedal inputs at high airspeeds, aircraft-pilot coupling, flight operations at or below an airplane\u2019s design maneuvering speed, and upset recovery training programs. Safety recommendations concerning these issues are addressed to the Federal Aviation Administration and the Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019Aviation Civile.", "report_number": "AAR-04-04", "mentions": {"event_date": [{"mention": "November 12, 2001", "start": 4, "length": 17}], "location_city": [{"mention": "Belle Harbor", "start": 164, "length": 12}], "location_state": [{"mention": "New York", "start": 178, "length": 8}, {"mention": "New York", "start": 263, "length": 8}], "airport_code": [], "airport_name": [{"mention": "John F.
