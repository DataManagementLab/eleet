{"text": "Summary (as of 27/01/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now assesses the level of threat to the\r\nhealth of the general population as very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 13,198 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 982 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were\r\ntransmitted to the RKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 101 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg,\r\nSaxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is markedly above the national incidence.\r\n\u2022 Of 412 districts, 380 have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 184 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000\r\npopulation and of these, 7 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 80 and of people \u226580 years 208 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in\r\nhouseholds, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 27/01/2021 (12:15 PM) 4,501 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, +549 existing patients\r\nhad been discharged (31% of whom had died) and +479 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under\r\ntreatment was -70 more than the prior day.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 1,672,215 people in Germany have been vaccinated at least once (vaccination rate 2.0%) and\r\n318,674 people twice against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).\r\n", "report_number": "2021-01-27", "mentions": {"date": [{"mention": "27/01/2021", "start": 15, "length":
