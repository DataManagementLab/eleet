{"text": "Summary (as of 09/01/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general\r\npopulation as very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 24,694 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 1.083 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to the\r\nRKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 154 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony and Thuringia, it is markedly above the national\r\nincidence.\r\n\u2022 All 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 320 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,\r\n49 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population, and two districts have an incidence of >500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 123 and of people \u226580 years 298 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households,\r\noccupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 09/01/2021 (12:15 PM) 5,414 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, +736 existing patients had been\r\ndischarged (33% of whom had died) and +666 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under treatment was -70 more than\r\nthe prior day.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 532,878 people in Germany have been vaccinated against COVID-19 (6,4 vaccinated per 1,000 population)\r\n(http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).\r\n\u2022 Testing and notification activities may have been lower during the festive season, resulting in a putatively incomplete
