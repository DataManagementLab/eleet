{"text": "Summary (as of 11/12/2020, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly\r\nencouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.\r\n\u2022 Since 04/12/2020, the case numbers show a sharp increase again.\r\n\u2022 The national 7-day incidence is 156 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony it is very clearly above, in Bavaria, Berlin and\r\nThuringia clearly above, and in Saarland and Baden Wuerttemberg somewhat above the national average.\r\n\u2022 Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day\r\nincidence of people \u226560 years is currently 143 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 Almost all of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. Only 7 districts have an incidence of \u226425\r\ncases/100,000 population. In comparison, 321 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,\r\n35 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and 2 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in\r\nhouseholds and nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to\r\nreligious events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.\r\n\u2022 With 4,432 cases, the current number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care continues to increase.\r\n\u2022 On 10/12/2020, 29,875 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the highest number since the beginning of the\r\npandemic, have been transmitted to the RKI in Germany, as well as 598 new deaths associated with COVID-19.\r\n\u2022 RKI\u2019s risk assessment was updated.
