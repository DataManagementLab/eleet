{"text": "Summary (as of 02/02/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany remains high. RKI assesses the level of\r\nthreat to the health of the general population to be very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 6,114 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 861 new deaths associated with COVID-19\r\nwere transmitted to the RKI. The national 7-day incidence is 90 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg,\r\nSaarland, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is markedly above the national incidence.\r\n\u2022 In 366 of the 412 districts, the 7-day COVID-19 incidence is high. In 146 districts, the 7-day incidence is >100\r\ncases/100,000 population and in 5 of these districts it is >250-500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence among people aged 60-79 years is currently 71 and of people aged \u226580 years, 172\r\ncases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters\r\nespecially in households, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 02/02/2021 (12:15 PM) 4,264 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, +493 existing patients had\r\nbeen discharged (30% of whom had died) and +435 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under\r\ntreatment was -58 more than the prior day.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 1,980,211 people in Germany have been vaccinated at least once (vaccination rate\r\n2.4%) and 606,786 people twice against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).", "report_number": "2021-02-02", "mentions": {"date": [{"mention": "02/02/2021", "start": 15, "length":
