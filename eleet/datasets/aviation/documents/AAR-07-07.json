{"text": "On February 7, 2006, about 2359 eastern standard time, United Parcel Service Company flight 1307, a McDonnell Douglas DC-8-71F, N748UP, landed at its destination airport, Philadelphia International Airport, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, after a cargo smoke indication in the cockpit. The captain, first officer, and flight engineer evacuated the airplane after landing. The flight crewmembers sustained minor injuries, and the airplane and most of the cargo were destroyed by fire after landing. The scheduled cargo flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 on an instrument flight rules flight plan. Night visual conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.\r\n\r\nThe safety issues discussed in this report include inadequacies in the following areas: guidance and checklists relating to in-flight fire and smoke, smoke and fire detection system test certification requirements, fire suppression system requirements, aircraft rescue and firefighting training, cargo airplane emergency exit requirements, hazardous materials information dissemination procedures, and transport of lithium batteries on board aircraft. Safety recommendations concerning these issues are addressed to the Federal Aviation Administration, the Cargo Airline Association, and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.",
