{"text": "Summary (as of 26/12/2020, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly encouraged to\r\ncommit itself to infection prevention and control with even greater dedication.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 14,455 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 240 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were transmitted to the RKI\r\nin Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 171 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony and Thuringia, it is markedly above the national\r\nincidence.\r\n\u2022 All of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 336 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,\r\n55 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and 6 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day incidence of people \u226560\r\nyears is currently 178 cases/100,000 population and above the national incidence since 23/12/2020.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in households and\r\nnursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 26/12/2020 (12:15 PM) 5,535 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the leading 24 hours, +473 existing patients had been\r\ndischarged (36% of which had died) and +620 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of ongoing cases was +147 more than the\r\nprior day.\r\n\u2022 RKI now judges the level of threat to the health of the general population as very high.\r\n\u2022 On 12/19/2020, a new virus variant was reported in the UK. The ECDC has published a Rapid Threat Assessment on 20/12/2020. To date, it is\r\nunknown how the new virus variant will affect the COVID-19 pandemic. So far, one case with the new variant virus has been reported in\r\nGermany (Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg). Further cases may be expected.\r\n\u2022 On December 25, no daily situation report was released by RKI; the report will also not be released on January 1, 2021. Testing and notification\r\nactivities may be lower during the festive season, resulting in a putatively incomplete picture of the epidemiological situation in Germany.", "report_number":
