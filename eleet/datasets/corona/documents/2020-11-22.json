{"text": "Summary (as of 22/11/2020, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, an increase of transmissions in the population in Germany can be observed. Therefore, the entire population is\r\nstrongly encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.\r\n\u2022 The nationwide incidence over the past 7 days is 141 cases per 100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day\r\nincidence of people \u2265 60 years is currently 109 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Bremen, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony is higher than the national total\r\n7-day incidence.\r\n\u2022 Almost all districts have a high 7-day incidence. Only 5 districts have an incidence of \u2264 25 cases/100,000 population. In\r\ncomparison, 276 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 26 districts have an incidence\r\nof >250 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters in households,\r\nbut also in community institutions, nursing and long-term care homes, as well as in occupational settings or related to\r\nreligious events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.\r\n\u2022 Since mid of October, the number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care has strongly increased, from 655 patients\r\non October 15th to 3,709 patients on 22/11/2020.\r\n\u2022 Until 21/11/2020, 15,741 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 138 new deaths associated with COVID-19 have\r\nbeen transmitted to the RKI in Germany.
