Summary (as of 09/12/2020, 12:00 AM)
• Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly
encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
• Since 04/12/2020, the case numbers are notably increasing again.
• The national 7-day incidence is 149 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony it is markedly above, in Bavaria, Berlin and
Thuringia moderately above and in Baden-Württemberg and Hesse marginally above the national average.
• Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
incidence of people ≥ 60 years is currently 136 cases/100,000 population.
• Almost all of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. Only 10 districts transmitted an incidence of ≤25
cases/100,000 population. In comparison, 293 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,
32 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and 2 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.
• The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in
households and nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to
religious events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.
• With 4,278 cases, the current number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care continues to increase (3,742 cases on
23/11/2020).
• On 09/12/2020, 20,815 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 590 new deaths associated with COVID-19 have
been transmitted to the RKI in Germany.
