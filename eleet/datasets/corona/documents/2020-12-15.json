{"text": "Summary (as of 15/12/2020, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly\r\nencouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control even more dedicatedly than before.\r\n\u2022 Since 04/12/2020, the case numbers show a sharp increase again. The national 7-day incidence is 174 cases per 100,000\r\npopulation. In Saxony and Thuringia, it is severely, in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, Berlin, Hesse and Saarland considerably\r\nabove the overall incidence.\r\n\u2022 Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day incidence of\r\npeople \u226560 years is currently 164 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 Almost all of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. Only 1 district has an incidence of \u226425 cases/100,000\r\npopulation. In comparison, 345 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 54 districts have an\r\nincidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and 2 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in\r\nhouseholds and nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to religious\r\nevents. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.\r\n\u2022 With 4,735 cases, the current number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care continues to increase.\r\n\u2022 On 14/12/2020, 14,432 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases have been transmitted to the RKI in Germany, as well as 500\r\nnew deaths associated with COVID-19.\r\n\u2022 RKI\u2019s risk assessment was updated. RKI now judges the level of danger to the health of the general population as very high.\r\n\u2022 The state of Saxony did not report any data since yesterday. Particularly the 7-day-incidence but other values as well are therefore\r\nnationally but especially in regard to Saxony lower than the actual values.\r\n", "report_number": "2020-12-15", "mentions":
