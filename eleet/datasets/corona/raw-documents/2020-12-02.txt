Summary (as of 02/12/2020, 12:00 AM)
• Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly
encouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.
• The 7-day incidence in Bavaria, Berlin, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saxony and Thuringia is higher than the national
total 7-day incidence of 134 cases per 100,000 population.
• Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day
incidence of people ≥ 60 years is currently 118 cases/100,000 population.
• Almost all districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. Only 11 districts have an incidence of ≤ 25 cases/100,000
population. In comparison, 274 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these, 24 districts have
an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and two districts of >500-1000 cases/100,000 population.
• The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in
households and nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to
religious events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.
• After the strong increase in the number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care until mid-November (3,395 cases on
15/11/2020), the increase has slowed somewhat, with 3,957 cases on 02/12/2020.
• On 01/12/2020, 17,270 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 487 new deaths associated with COVID-19 have
been transmitted to the RKI in Germany.
