{"text": "Summary (as of 10/12/2020, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. Therefore, the entire population is strongly\r\nencouraged to commit itself to infection prevention and control.\r\n\u2022 Since 04/12/2020, the case numbers are notably increasing again.\r\n\u2022 The national 7-day incidence is 149 cases per 100,000 population. In Saxony it is considerably above, in Bavaria, Berlin and\r\nThuringia moderately above the national average.\r\n\u2022 Since the beginning of September, the proportion of cases in older age groups has been increasing again. The 7-day\r\nincidence of people \u2265 60 years is currently 138 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 Almost all of the 412 districts have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. Only 10 districts transmitted an incidence of \u226425\r\ncases/100,000 population. In comparison, 303 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population and of these,\r\n37 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population and 2 districts of >500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in\r\nhouseholds and nursing and long-term care homes, but also in occupational settings, community facilities and related to\r\nreligious events. For a large proportion of cases the transmission setting remains unclear.\r\n\u2022 With 4,339 cases, the current number of COVID-19 cases treated in intensive care continues to increase.\r\n\u2022 On 09/12/2020, 23,679 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the highest number since the beginning of the\r\npandemic, have been transmitted to the RKI in Germany, as well as 440 new deaths associated with COVID-19.
