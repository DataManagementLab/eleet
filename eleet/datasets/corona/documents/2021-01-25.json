{"text": "Summary (as of 25/01/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now assesses the level of threat to the health\r\nof the general population as very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 6,729 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 217 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were\r\ntransmitted to the RKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 111 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg, Saxony,\r\nSaxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is markedly above the national incidence.\r\n\u2022 Of 412 districts, 393 have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 220 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000 population\r\nand of these, 12 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 87 and of people \u226580 years 235 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in\r\nhouseholds, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 25/01/2021 (12:15 PM) 4,619 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care. In the preceding 24 hours, +450 existing patients had\r\nbeen discharged (38% of whom had died) and +441 patients were newly admitted. The resulting number of cases under\r\ntreatment was -9 more than the prior day.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 1,554,355 people in Germany have been vaccinated at least once (vaccination rate 1.9%) and\r\n228,763 people twice against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).", "report_number": "2021-01-25", "mentions": {"date": [{"mention": "25/01/2021", "start": 15, "length":
