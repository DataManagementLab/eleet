{"text": "Summary (as of 20/01/2021, 12:00 AM)\r\n\u2022 Currently, the number of transmissions in the population in Germany is high. RKI now assesses the level of threat to the\r\nhealth of the general population as very high.\r\n\u2022 Yesterday, 15,974 new laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as 1,148 new deaths associated with COVID-19 were\r\ntransmitted to the RKI in Germany. The national 7-day incidence is 123 cases per 100,000 population. In Brandenburg,\r\nSaxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia it is markedly above the national incidence.\r\n\u2022 Of 412 districts, 393 have a high 7-day COVID-19 incidence. 255 districts have an incidence of >100 cases/100,000\r\npopulation and of these, 26 districts have an incidence of >250-500 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The 7-day incidence of people 60-79 years is currently 95 and of people \u226580 years 268 cases/100,000 population.\r\n\u2022 The high nationwide number of cases is caused by increasingly diffuse transmission, with numerous clusters especially in\r\nhouseholds, occupational settings and nursing and long-term care homes.\r\n\u2022 On 20/01/2021, 4,836 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care (-111 cases fewer than the day before). Due to ongoing\r\ncorrections by several hospitals, today\u2019s numbers of completed ICU treatments and new admissions to ICU as well as\r\ndifferences to the previous day are not reported.\r\n\u2022 Since 26/12/2020 a total of 1,254,760 people in Germany have been vaccinated once (vaccination rate 1.5%) and 42,670\r\npeople twice against COVID-19 (http://www.rki.de/covid-19-impfquoten).\r\n\u2022
